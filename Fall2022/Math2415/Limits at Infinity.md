Limits at Inifinty
---

What is the limit of x → infinity of x^2?

It would be +infinity
$$
x=10
$$
$$
10^{2}=100
$$
What is the limit of x → -inifinity of x^2

It would be +infinity
$$
x=-10
$$
$$-10^{2}=100
$$

What would be the limit of x → -infinity of x^3

It would be -infinity
$$
x = -10
$$
$$
(-10)\times(-10)\times(-10)=-1000
$$
What would be the limit of x → +infinity of x^3

It would be +infinity
$$
x = 10
$$
$$
10 \times10 \times10= 1000
$$
What would be the limit of x → -infinity of 5 + 2x - x^3

5 and 2x would become insignificant to x^3 since it grows exponentially. You can ignore the two but make sure to include a negative outside of x^3 since 2x would cause a negative with x → -infinity.
$$
[-x^{3}]=-(-\infty^{3})=-(-\infty)= +\infty
$$
What is the limit of x → -infinity of 3x^3-5x^4?

3x^3 would become insignificant to -5x^4 since it would grow exponentially fast than 3x^3 due to it being to the power of 4 and multiplied by 5.

$$
-5x^4=-5(-\infty)^{4}=-5(+\infty)=-\infty
$$
What is the limit of x → infinity of 1/x
$$
\frac{1}{10}= 0.1
$$
$$
\frac{1}{100}=0.01
$$
$$
\frac{1}{1000}=0.001
$$
The end product starts to approach 0 so we can say that lim x → infinity of 1/x = 0. Additionally as x approaches any large number for any rational function or a function where its bottom heavy, meaning the degree of the denominator is greater than the numerator, it will always be 0. 
Example:
lim x → -infinity of 1/x^2
$$
\frac{1}{x^{2}}=0
$$
Since the degree of the denominator (2) is greater than the numerator (1) it would be 0 as since x would grow it would also approach 0.

Anytime a function is bottom heavy and the limit is at infinity then the product will be 0.
Example:
lim x → infinity
$$
\frac{5x+2}{7x-x^{2}}
$$
Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2) the product will be 0
$$
\frac{5x+2}{7x-x^{2}}= 0
$$
The way to solve this with work is by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1/over the highest degree. In this case that would be x^2 so it would look like this:
$$
\frac{5x+2}{7x-x^{2}}\times\frac{\frac{1}{x^{2}}}{\frac{1}{x^{2}}} = \frac{\frac{5}{x}+\frac{2}{x^{2}}}{\frac{7}{x}-1}=\frac{0+0}{0-1}=0
$$
Okay let’s explain how this works. 5x {times} 1/x^2= 5/x bc it eliminiates the x from 5x leaving 5/x still. Since x is the larger degree 5/x becomes 0.

2 {times} 1/x^2 becomes 2/x^2 and since x^2 is the larger degree it also becomes 0

7x {times} 1/x^2 becomes 7/x since 7x removes one of the x’s from x^2 leaving 7/x and since x is the larger degree it becomes 0

The end product is 0+0/0-1 which equals 0 in the end. 

New Example:
lim x → infinity of 8x^2-5x/4x^2+7 

Since the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same you divide the coefficents (8/4 = 2) so the limit is 2 but to show your work this is how it goes 
$$
\frac{8x^{2}-5x}{4x^{2}+7}\times\frac{\frac{1}{x^{2}}}{\frac{1}{x^{2}}}=\frac{8-\frac{5}{x}}{4+\frac{7}{x^{2}}}=\frac{8-0}{4+0}=2

That is how to find the limit x → -infinity of 5x-7x^3/2x^2+14x^3-9
