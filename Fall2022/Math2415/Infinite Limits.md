### Infinite Limits

#### Infinite Limits Introduction
---
For infinite limits you have to look at the limit from the left side and right side. Originial limit: lim x → 0
$$
\frac{1}{x}
$$
Limit from the left side: lim x → 0-
$$
\frac{1}{-0.1}= -10
$$
$$
\frac{1}{-0.01}=-100
$$
$$
\frac{1}{-0.001}=-1000
$$
We can say that the limit approaches -infinity

Limit from the right side: lim x → 0+
$$
\frac{1}{0.1}= 10
$$
$$
\frac{1}{0.01}=100
$$
$$
\frac{1}{0.001}=1000
$$
We can that the limit approaches +infinity 

If the denominator is 0 it is undefined but if its *close* to 0 it will be infinity

Since the two limits do not match the limit does not exist. $$
\frac{1}{x}=DNE
$$
Another example of infinite limits
lim x → 0 
$$
\frac{1}{x^{2}}
$$
lim x → 0-
$$
\frac{1}{x^{2}} = \frac{1}{(0-^{2})}=\frac{1}{(0+)^{2}} 
$$
This equates to positive infinity

lim x → 0+
$$
\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\frac{1}{(0+^{2)}}
$$
Since the two limits match, the limit lim x → 0 = +infinity

lim x → 2- = 1/x-2

$$
\frac{1}{x-2} = \frac{1}{1.9-2}= \frac{1}{-0.1}= -10 = -\infty
$$
so lim x → = -infinity because it continuously approach 1.9, 1.99, and etc

lim x → 3+ = 5/x-3
$$
\frac{5}{x-3}=\frac{5}{3.1-3}=\frac{5}{0.1}= 50= +\infty
$$
so the lim x →3+ = 5/x-3 is +infinity because it continuously approach 3.1, 3.01, and etc.

lim x → -4- = 15/x+4
$$
\frac{15}{x+4}=\frac{15}{-4.1+4}=\frac{15}{-0.1}=-150 
$$
the limit x → 4-4- is -infinity

lim x → 2+ = -8/x-2
$$
\frac{-8}{x-2}=\frac{-8}{2+-2}=\frac{-8}{0+}=-8\times \infty= -\infty
$$


#### Trigonometric Function
---
lim x → pi/2+ = tan x 
$$
tan \frac{\pi}{2} = undefined
$$
pi/2 = 90 degrees
$$
tan [90.1]=-5.73
$$
$$
tan[90.01]=-5730
$$

$$
tan \frac{\pi}{2}+ = -\infty
$$
lim x → pi/2- = tan x
$$
tan[89.9] = +573 = tan x =+\infty
$$
Since the limits do not match the limit does not exist for tan x 
Note:
$$
tanx = \frac{sinx}{cosx}
$$
#### Vertical Asymptote
---

How to find the vertical asymptote of a function:

To find the vertical asymptote of a function you would need to set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x.

Example
$$
\frac{1}{x+2} = x+2 = 0
$$
$$
x=-2 
$$
Example 2
$$
\frac{1}{x^{2}-4} = \frac{1}{(x-2)(x+2)}
$$
The vertical asymptotes of this is $$
x = -2, 2
$$
